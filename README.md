# ASCII Art Text Generator

This program is an ASCII art text generator written in C++. It allows users to input any string, and the program converts the characters into an ASCII art representation. The ASCII art for each character is predefined and stored in the program. The output can be displayed in the terminal or saved to a text file.

## Features:

* Dynamic Input: Users can enter any text, and the program will convert each letter into ASCII art.
* Predefined Character Map: Each letter (A-Z) has a corresponding ASCII art design stored in the program, which gets used to form the final text.
* Text Output: The generated ASCII art is printed to the console and can also be saved to a .txt file for later use.

## How It Works:

* The user inputs a string (which can include uppercase letters).
* The program matches each letter to its corresponding ASCII art representation using a predefined map.
* The individual ASCII art letters are combined to form the complete string in ASCII art.
* The result is printed to the console and saved to a file named ascii_art.txt.

## Example:

For example, if the user inputs the word "Student", the program will display the word in ASCII art using the predefined styles for each letter.

## Usage:

To run the program, simply compile the main.cpp file and execute. You can input any text and the program will generate the corresponding ASCII art output.
